# Quarterly Meetings

This community meets 4 times per year to discuss ways in which they can help support the growth of existing communities and attract new communities to building digital skills capacity at research organizations around the world. Come learn from senior community leaders and get support as you work to build your own local community. 


# [Carpentries Community Cookbook](https://cookbook.carpentries.org)

The Community Cookbook is a set of documentation to help community champions new and old, learn and share structures, tools and approaches to building local communities. From how to run a HackyHour, ResBaz or ThatCamp, to what tools are best for keeping in contact with your community. This is a living document meant to be owned and maintained by those who are building local communities.
